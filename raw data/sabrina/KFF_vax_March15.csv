"Sources"
"KFF analysis of publicly available data from state websites. Data retrieved on April 12, 2021."

"Definitions"
"*NR*: Data are not reported on the state website."

"Notes"
"Percentages are based on total vaccinations for which race/ethnicity is known. Shares of vaccinations in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding, pending, or missing data. Vaccination data may not be directly comparable due to differences in data reported, reporting periods, racial/ethnic classifications, and/or rates of unknown race/ethnicity. Where states report vaccination data for people of multiple races, we include this data in the Other category. As of 3/15, KFF only reports state-reported unknown race/ethnicity data. If a state does not report the number or share of vaccinations with unknown race/ethnicity, it is reported as NR."
""
"States vary in whether they report total people who have received at least one vaccine dose, people who have received one dose and people who are fully vaccinated, or total vaccinations administered. Where possible, we report data for people who have received at least one vaccine dose. Some states exclude vaccinations administered through the federal long-term care partnership from their data, which affects the demographic profile of people who have received vaccinations."
""
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals in racial categories. States also vary in their racial/ethnic classifications. For example, some states report Asian and Pacific Islander people separately while others report them as a combined group.Total population data has been adjusted to reflect a states’ racial/ethnic classifications for vaccination data."


Footnotes
"1. Data for Hispanic people are not reported because the majority of ethnicity data are missing for the state."
"2. Data will not reflect people receiving the single dose of the Janssen vaccine because the data reflects people receiving the first dose of two-dose vaccinations."
"3. As of 3/29, the state dashboard reports that the number of vaccinations of multiracial people are being overcounted due to a technical issue."
"4. As of 4/12, KFF began reporting the sum of partially and fully vaccinated people for Nebraska; previous periods reflected partially vaccinated or first dose administered counts."
"5. North Dakota reports vaccination rates by race/ethnicity but does not report vaccine distribution by race/ethnicity."
"6. Data does not include Philadelphia County due to differences in reporting data."
"7. South Carolina reports data for Asian, NHOPI, and AIAN people as a single category. We report this data in the ""Other"" category."
"8. Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity; totals may not sum to 100%."
