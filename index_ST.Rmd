# Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic continues to highlight inequality in health outcomes in the United States. As of April 23rd, 2021, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html#footnote02) reports that Hispanic, Black, and American Indian or Alaska Native people are more likely to test positive for, be hospitalized for, and die from Covid-19 when compared to white, non-Hispanic people. Considering these disparities alongside recent developments in vaccine distribution, we became curious as to how race and ethnicity relate to immunization rates in each state.

Various data sources have presented vaccination progress in terms of each state’s efficiency (use of allocated vaccines) and speed (proportion of population that is vaccinated). We have developed a range of visualizations to consider how race and ethnicity relate to vaccine progress in the United States. 

## Are states vaccinating demographic groups proportionally to their share of the population?

One of our goals was to make a visualization to see whether demographic groups were receiving their share of Covid-19 vaccines. We present this using a Hexbin map, a 2-D density technique where each state is represented with a hexagon. The Kaiser Family Foundation [(KFF)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/covid-19-vaccinations-by-race-ethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) collects data on the percentage of vaccines that have been distributed to six racial and ethnic group. They began publishing this on March 1, 2021 and have recently been re-publishing this weekly. [KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/) also maintains a dataset of population distribution by race and ethnicity in each state. We developed a “demographic metric” comparing these two values to be able to indicate whether demographic groups were receiving a proportionate share of vaccinations: 

$$Demographic Metric = \tfrac{% of vaccines that went to a given group in a state}{% of state population that is made up of that group}$$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-s21.github.io/Blog-Food-and-PUG-Administration/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
